// everything in javascript happens inside an execution context

// first component of the execution context is the memory component
// it stores the variables and functions as key value pairs
// it is also known as variable environment

// second component of the execution context is the code component
// here, code is executed one line at a time
// it is also known as the thread of execution

// javascript is a synchronous (the next line will be executed only after the current line execution is done) single threaded (it can execute one command at a time) language
