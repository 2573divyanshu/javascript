// example 1

// a gec is created for empty code too

// whenever an ec is created
// a global object is also created
// this keyword is also created

// about this
// at the global level this points to the window object

// about global object for browser environments
// the global object for browser environments is the window object
// the properties and method available inside the window object are created by the javascript engine and are available in the global space
// different environments have different global object

// about spaces
// global space is space outside any function
// space in a function is local scope

// all the variables and function created in the global space are attached to the window object
// so we can access these variables and functions either by their name or by window.their_name
