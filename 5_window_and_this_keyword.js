// example 1

// a gec is created for empty code too
// a window object is also created
// the properties and method available inside the window object are created by the javascript engine and are available in the global space
// this keyword is also created
// at the global level this points to the window object
// window is a global object which is created alongwith the gec

// whenever a gec is created a global object is created
// in case of browsers the global object is the window object

// different environments have different global object

// whenever an ec is created a this keyword is also created

// global space is space outside any function

// space in a function is local scope

// all the variables and function created in the global space are attached to the window object
// we can access these variables and functions either by their name or by window.their_name
